This web page will return a random joke to a client. Then the page allow users to donate a cent via Stripe payment system if they like the joke.

My learning goal for this project was to get myself more familiarize with Python language and Flask framework along with use of multiple APIs at a single project.

The end-result will soon be deloyed via Heroku, and the links will be provided here, soon.
